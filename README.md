## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Js
- Flexbox


### What I learned

My biggest takeaway from this challenge was the linking and callback to classes and ids from the html file to the Js file, being able to pull html content from one place and insert it into another (rating/score from the button to the result).
Also learning about the defer and async method for loading the Js file.

### Continued development

I'm finally comfortbale with centering block content in the middle of a page.
I'll probably focus on creating more grid based layouts, as well as implementing Js more.


### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnUopEeZgw&t) - Although this video is a walkthrough on how to complete this challenge, I used it mostly for when I got stuck on things I didn't know, like setting variables based on classes or ids set in the HTML, as well as implementing the addEventListener method.
